# Embedded Systems and Information Processing Master 2 programme, Paris-Saclay University & Institut Polytechnique de Paris
## A0 Architecture des processeurs

This repository aims to show a little of the work developed as part of the **processors architecture** course in my master's degree programme. The code and analysis here discussed had their beginnings in the assignments provided by the professor in charge of the course. We worked in a group composed of 4 students.

## How to Contribute to the Project
- Any implementation that could lead to a more automatic function call for the different methods already designed without recompiling would be a nice improvement for this project.
